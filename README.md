* Independent variable: covariate, predictors, features

### Steps in  modelling with tenosrFlow
1. get the data ready
2. Build or pick a pre-trained model
3. Fit the model to the sdata and make a prediction
4. Evaluate the model
5. Improve through experimentation
6. Save and reload your pretarained model


### Common Ways to improve the model
1. Adding more layers
2. Adding more hidden units
3. Changing the activation function
4. Changin gthe optimizer
5. Chnaging the learning rate
6. Fitting for more epochs
7. Fitting on more data
